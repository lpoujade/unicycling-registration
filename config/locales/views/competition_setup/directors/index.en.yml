        description: |
          Directors are assigned to a Event-class. They will be able to
          create/manage start lists, judges, and data-entry volunteers for their competitions.
        note_1: |
          A competition must be configured by the "Competition Admin"
          (that's probably you) before the director is able to manage the start lists
          for the competition.
        note_2: |
          Directors cannot create the competitions themselves because choosing
          the particular settings for a Competition is usually much more nuanced
          than Directors may be aware.
