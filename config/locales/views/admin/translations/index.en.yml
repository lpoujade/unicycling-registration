          Once you are finished translating various files (and have
          "applied the changes" if doing common translations), you may
          need to clear the page caching so that all possible pages are refreshed.
        clear_translation_action: Clear Translation Cache
        clear_translation_confirm: |
          Are you sure? This has performance impacts as the cache is
          rebuilt (please don't do this frequently)
