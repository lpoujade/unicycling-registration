      description_1: |
        By assigning a user "Additional Access", their user account will become
        selectable in the Judge and Data-Entry Volunteer lists.
      description_2: |
        Adding a user here allows them to view the "Data Entry" menu, and allows
        them to be assigned as judges and data-entry volunteer.
      description_3: |
        You can also set the user's "name" here, so that you don't have to remember
        their e-mail address.
      assign_access: Assign Additional Access
      note: Assigning Access also confirms unconfirmed e-mail accounts so that they can immediately log in.
