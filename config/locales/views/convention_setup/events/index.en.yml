          Each Event describes something different that a Competitor can compete in.
          <br>
          Different classes of competition (e.g. Jr Expert, Advanced, Expert) are
          considered "Event Categories" if
          the competitor can only choose a single one of these.
          <br>
          If a competitor can compete in both "Beginner X" as well as "Advanced X", they should be separate Events.
