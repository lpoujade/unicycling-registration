          When registering, we can ask each registrant whether they want to volunteer (generic),
          or ask them specific questions (e.g. Do you want to volunteer for Track?) (choice),
          or ask them no volunteering questions (none).
        next_step: 'After you choose "choice", you can set the choices in the "Volunteer Opportunities" setting page'
