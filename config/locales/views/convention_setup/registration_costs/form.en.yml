        registration_costs_increase_description_html: |
          Traditionally, online registration closes a little before the convention
          starts, and on-site registration is only allowed in the registration-hall, on convention-controlled computers.
          <br>
          This allows coordination of printing registration packets, preparing
          competitor lists, and other last-minute minutae
          <br>
          Setting a Registration Cost as "On-Site" causes the 'Online Registration Closes'
          banner to be displayed appropriately in the Cost tables
        last_minute_note: |
          Because many people only pay at the last possible minute, the price automatically increases ~36 hours after
          end of the End Date. This allows last-minute registrants a reprieve. (and also many last-minute registrants)
