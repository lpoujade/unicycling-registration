        range_description: Each registration cost will define the range of dates that a user can register for the event at each price.
        timezone_logic_description: |
          Because the users may live in different timezones, in order to be fair to everyone,
          the system will ALLOW paying the initial price until up to 1 full day after the registration period ends.
          (depending on the location of the server)
        timezone_logic_example: |
          If the first registration period is Until April 20th,
          Registrants will be able to pay the initial price until the server thinks that it is April 22nd.
