5.10.1 Removing The High And Low
After determining placing points as above, discard the highest and lowest placing score
for each rider. If Rider A has scores of 1,2,1,3,2, take out one of the ones, and the three.
Then Rider A has 1,2,2, for a total of 5. If Rider B has scores of 2,2,2,2,2, he will end
up with 2,2,2, a total of 6. The winner is the competitor with the lowest total placing
points score after the high and low have been removed.

5.10.2 Ties
If more than one competitor has the same placing score after the above process, those
riders will be ranked based on their placing scores for Technical. The scoring process
must be repeated using only the Technical scores for the tied riders to determine this
rank. High and low placing scores are again removed in the process. If competitorsâ€™
Technical ranking comes out equal, all competitors with the same score are awarded the
same place.
