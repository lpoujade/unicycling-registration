%h1 New Competition

%p
  There is a separation between Event Registration and Competitions.
  %ul
    %li
      %b Event Registration
      is what the registrant desires to compete in
    %li
      %b Competition
      is the actual competition in which they compete.
  %b Note
  For Pairs, Group, Team sports, each Competitor will include many registrants.
  %br
  %b Note
  Registering for an Event doesn't guarantee that the registrant will be in the Competition,
  and neither does it prevent them from being included in the Competitor List.
  It is up to the Event Director to manage the Competitor List and deal with discrepancies.

%p
  Competition Creation/Configuration can be very difficult, depending on whether your particular
  event is running the competition differently than tradition.
  This system allows for many different configuration options, which should be able
  to support your competition no matter how you choose to run it.
