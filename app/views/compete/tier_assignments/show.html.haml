  To make it easier for you, we provide a
  = link_to "Draft Assignments CSV", competition_tier_assignments_path(@competition, format: :csv), class: "button tiny"
  file.
  %br
  %b Note
  Each row must contain a valid Registrant ID, Tier, and Tier description.

  = form_tag competition_tier_assignments_path(@competition), method: :put, multipart: true do
    = render partial: "shared/upload_file_for_competition", locals: { competition: @competition }
    = submit_tag "Upload Tier assignments", class: "button"

  Specifying a Tier # will cause them to be ranked AFTER anyone with a lower # tier.

  e.g. tier 1 competitors are ranked above all tier 2 competitors, who are ranked above tier 3 competitors.
