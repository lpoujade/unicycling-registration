  %b Note
  The translations occur on a separate site, so that they can be reviewed before being published here on the main registration site.

%p
  %b Note
  We are continually making changes to the site and its contents, and thus there are frequently new and changed texts which
  need translating.
  %br
  We may periodically send out updates to the translators asking for them to review new text and submit new translations.
