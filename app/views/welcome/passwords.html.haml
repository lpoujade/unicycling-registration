%h1 Accounts persist convention-to-convention

%p
  As of February 2017, the Unicycling Registration site (this site)
  has a single User account for all of your conventions.

%h2 What this means?

%ul
  %li
    If you had accounts from past conventions, you can sign in to any of them
    using your current password. Your current password is the password which you have
    used most recently to sign in to any convention.
  %li
    After you have signed up for your first convention, you will not need to sign
    up again in future years/conventions. You can use the same e-mail & password each
    time.
  %li
    Changing your password will change the password you use to sign in to all conventions
