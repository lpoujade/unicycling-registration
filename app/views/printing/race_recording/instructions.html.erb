Fast Track Events
Summary:
− Covers all Races that occur ON the track (Fast, multi-heat events)
− 100m, 400m, 800m, One Foot, Wheel Walk
− Only Competitors are allowed on the track, coaches/parents must stay in the stands
− Common “false-start” rules about DQ

Roles:
Announcer
− Announce the age-group, as well as the age-group that should report to the Line-Up area
− should not announce names of any competitors that are not present in the line-up area

Line-Up
− Line up each heat of racers separately, in a separate marshaling area
− Check:
 − wheel-size
 − crank size
 − required safety gear: shoes, knee-pads, gloves
 − ID Number (and ensure that it is the right ID number)
− Put the lane number sticker on the helmet (or hip) of each competitor (facing the camera)
 - Ask that the competitor keep their lane number sticker, for possible use in subsequent races.

HEAT ASSIGNMENT RULES:
- You cannot compbine genders or age-groups without Race Director Approval
- You cannot combine 20" and 24" competitions.
- NEVER re-use a heat #, ever.
- Do not asign heats to future age groups (see above rule)
 - Which means that once you finish an age group's registration, that is done.
- Try to re-use Hip Numbers (ie: lane numbers)
- the fastest competitor is typically assigned to lane 1

Exceptions:
- When a racer has to re-run, you should fit them into a future heat. (a heat which would otherwise not be full), but give the racer a little time to rest

− Explain the False-start rules?
 - If you False Start twice, you're done.

− Explain DQ due to crossing lanes
 - Crossing the tape is considered a DQ
 - If you are interfered with, you can ride around the person in your lane, otherwise if you leave your lane you will be DQ'd


800m:
− 800m: if using waterfall start, can cut in immediately, if using staggered start, must wait until a certain point to cut in
 - You are not DQ for crossing the line
− Explain passing rules for 800m
 - Maintain a safe distance from the next rider (defined as "wheels at least 24" apart")

Relay:
− Relay: Remount is allowed
− Baton must be passed during the passing area, or will be DQ'd
− The next person may start anywhere on the track within their lane (doesn't have to be within the 'passing area')


False-Start Judge
− Must whistle if a false-start is detected
− Must clearly indicate who false-started
− Must clearly indicate to the Finish-Line Judge who has been DQ'd for false-start reasons
− Is responsible for the One-Foot DQ line as well

Finish Line Judge
− Must clearly note on the data any competitor:
 −  who starts
 −  who DQ's (False-starts, etc)
 −  Must indicate the reason for each DQ. Was it false-start? Was it falling off? Was it equipment? Was it not showing up?
 −  who did NOT show up (if people are assigned to heats (UNICON rule))

Physical Setup Hints:
− Marshalling area should be clearly marked with pylons and should be managed in a way that makes it obvious when heats should move forward
− The finish line should know who is in each lane in each heat, and should record notes on the paper copy, to support the electronic copy.
− The camera MUST be set to “thousands”
