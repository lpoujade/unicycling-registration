		I acknowledge that by signing this document, I am assuming risks, and agreeing to 
		indemnify, not to sue, and release from liability the organizer of this event and 
		their respective agents, employees, volunteers, members, clubs, sponsors, promoters, 
		and affiliates (collectively "Releasees"), and that I am giving up substantial legal 
		rights.  This release is a contract with legal and binding consequences and it 
		applies to all races and activities entered at the event, regardless whether or not 
		listed above.  I have read it carefully before signing, and I understand what it 
		means and what I am agreeing to by signing.
		</p>
		<p>
		In consideration of the issuance of a license to me by one or more Releasees or the 
		acceptance of my application for entry in the above event, I hereby freely agree to 
		and make the following contractual representations and agreements.  I ACKNOWLEDGE 
		THAT CYCLING IS AN INHERENTLY DANGEROUS SPORT AND FULLY REALIZE THE DANGERS OF 
		PARTICIPATING IN THIS EVENT, whether as a rider, official, coach, mechanic, 
		volunteer, or otherwise, and FULLY ASSUME THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH 
		PARTICIPATION  INCLUDING, by way of example, and not limitation: dangers associated 
		with manmade and natural jumps; the dangers of collision with pedestrians, vehicles, 
		other riders, and fixed or moving objects; the dangers arising from surface hazards, 
		including pot holes, equipment failure, inadequate safety equipment, use of equipment 
		or materials provided by the event organizer and others, THE RELEASEES' OWN 
		NEGLIGENCE, the negligence of others and weather conditions; and the possibility of 
		serious physical and/or mental trauma or injury, or death associated with the event.  
		For myself, my heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, assignees, 
		and successors in interest (collectively "Successors") I HEREBY WAIVE, RELEASE, 
		DISCHARGE, HOLD HARMLESS, AND PROMISE TO INDEMNIFY AND NOT TO SUE the Releasees and 
		all sponsors, organizers and promoting organizations, property owners, law 
		enforcement agencies, public entities, special districts and properties that are in 
		any manner connected with this event, and their respective agents, officials, and 
		employees through or by which the event will be held, (the foregoing are also 
		collectively deemed to be Releasees), FROM ANY AND ALL RIGHTS AND CLAIMS INCLUDING 
		CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE RELEASEES' OWN NEGLIGENCE TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
		LAW, which I have or which may hereafter accrue to me and from any and all damages 
		which may be sustained by me directly or indirectly in connection with, or arising 
		out of, my participation in or association with the event, or travel to or return 
		from the event.
		</p>
	
	</div>
	<div style="width:48%; float:right;">
		<p>
		I agree it is my sole responsibility to be familiar with the event course and agenda, 
		the Releasees' rules, and any special regulation for the event and agree to comply 
		with all such rules and regulations.  I understand and agree that situations may 
		arise during the event which may be beyond the control of the Releasees, and I must 
		continually ride and otherwise participate so as to neither endanger myself nor 
		others.  I accept responsibility for the condition and adequacy of my equipment and 
		any equipment provide for my use, and my conduct in connection with this event.  I 
		will wear a helmet and protective gear which satisfies the requirements of the 
		Releasees' Racing Rules and Regulations and that can protect against serious head 
		injury, and assume all responsibility and liability for the selection of such a 
		helmet.  
		</p>
		<p>
		I have no physical or medical condition which would endanger myself or others if I 
		participate in this event, or would interfere with my ability to safely participate 
		in this event. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I agree, for myself and my Successors, that the above representations are 
		contractually binding, and are not mere recitals, and that should I or my Successors 
		assert a claim contrary to what I have agreed to in this contract, the claiming party 
		shall be liable for the expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the Releasees in 
		defending the claims.  This contract may not be modified orally, and a waiver or 
		modification of any provision shall not be construed as a waiver or modification of 
		any other provision heron or as consent to any subsequent waiver or modification.  
		</p>
		<p>
		I consent to release by any third party to Releasees and their insurance carriers of 
		my name and medical information that may relate solely to any injury or death I may 
		suffer arising from the event.  Every term and provision of this contract is intended 
		to be severable.  If any one or more of them is found to be unenforceable or invalid, 
		that shall not affect the other terms and provisions, which shall remain binding and 
		enforceable.
