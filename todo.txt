Last Re-Arranged June 20th, 2014.


===== Questions to be answered, by whom
- Connie/Patricia/Hugo/Benoit - What are the age groups for the events at NAUCC, and at UNICON?
 - Who should be able to modify the age group entries? (we usually share age groups among competitions...so I don't want to be able to change them once they are in use, right?)
- Hugo/Benoit/Ptricia - What "Overall Champions" do you want at NAUCC/UNICON, and what calculation would you like used for this? (the rulebook only lists Track)
- Connie: when should the Overall Champion calculation be updated? Whenever data is entered? approved? published? awarded?
- Spencer Hotchberg - director of Flatland, please check with him for the scoring/needs of his event, for “Double elimination”.
 - What e-scoring do you want/need?
- Should we change the way that the data recording forms are written for NAUCC?
 - On the Competitors List:
  - Split it by ID only, then record their 2 times
  - See the gender of the competition, or split the competitors by gender.
- Scott, I have some comments/questions about the IUF Rulebook, can I send them your way?
- Hugo/Benoit: What have you allocated for Awards? Can you send me a breakdown? Will it be medals? what size? for which places for which event? Are you giving out ribbons for Basketball/Hockey B-League? etc etc
- Freestyle Artistic Director - Are we dealing with "Boundary Scores" anymore? Is this officially gone?
- Hugo/Benoit (or the specific Director) - What is X-Style, judging-related.
- Hugo/Benoit: how are you recording Slow Races? Do you have E-Timer for that?
- Connie/Scott: Rulebook question: can a 0-10 20” racing-categroy competitor win the expert slow… If so, then any competitor (no matter what wheel) can win. Expert will be non-wheel-size.
- ???? Relay, does 4x100 compete by wheel-size /age group, or against everyone?
- Scott/Hugo/benoit - UNICON rule: Scott, can we add a rule to Trials for tie-breakers, so that we know that people need to be present for tie-breaking.
- Patricia/NAUCC-director: Patricia: what is the NAUCC rules for Trials? Hand-vs-not-hands? (how are points calculated?)
- Hugo/Benoit - Are they running Standard Skill without Data?
- Huge/Benoit/Scott/Patricia/Mary - What is the value - Online system which allows the public to see the Competitor List for each event.
- Patricia - Enable/Promote the "Submit your music" system?

- Kathleen (on monday):
 - How should the Lane Assignments screen behave?
  - Should it only show "Competitors" in one box, and "non-signed up" in another?
  - How should it behave for "Final Heat" events (100m Expert)?

Connie: How does the "Overall Track" calculation work when there is a Tie? (ie: tie for 1st, do both get 8 points, or do they split 8+6=14, thus 7 points each)


===== Development Items that MUST be done before we do another run-through/demo
- Able to enter results for multiple competitions at once (10k Standard and 10k Unlimited).
- Able to Edit/Update Two-Attempt Entry
- Have a way to publish results for a single Age group (for 100m, for example), while the competition itself continues to run.
  - When publishing 100m results, have a different PDF for each age group, “50+ Female”
  - So, only publish the “Per Event” PDF after the event is over, but have “50+ “ and “40+ “ separately while the event is running.
  - Change the “Competition Status” to be less granular…perhaps “Unstarted, Started, and Completed”.
  - When publishing the 100m results by age group, also have the ability to see the results overall (without age groups)
 - Determine who will be doing the 100m Review/Publish datastep
 - When/how do we publish 100m results?
 - Able to assign "Track Data Importer" role

- Able to Do High/Long with the design changes as per conversation with Mary
- Able to assign "High/Long" data importer role (????already done via a judge?)
  - and prevent them from adding scores after the event is "locked"
- Ensure that a Judge cannot update their score after the event is Locked.

- Make it impossible for more import results to be entered once an event has been locked also.
- Make it possible/easy for a Director to access the raw data (time_results/external_results) after importing
 - Make this transition of data clearer/better.
- Excel export of Competitior lists, for Hugo/E-Timer People ((nom, prenom, sexe, categorie, dossard))
 - Also have the "Event Report" be exported in Excel format
- Migrate the Judging Types to include the new ranges as per the new rulebook.


===== Configuration items
- Configure all competitinos for UNICON, including assigning directors to events, and sending them welcome e-mails asking them to begin assigning registrants to competitions.
 - Ask them also for the breakdowns of their competitions (as applicable)

===== Development Items that must be done for UNICON, but NOT NAUCC
- Add a way to display the overall places for 100m on the Results page (to help people identify the "Finalists")
- Test the use of HTML5 forms in other browsers
  - When trying to type a long number in the seconds column, it would silently not allow me to submit.
 - Install a set of fallbacks?
 - Install something which does autoprefixing/etc?
- Improve the Excel Data import functions
- Improve the performance of the site:
 - CompetitionsController#result
 - WelcomeController#data_entry_menu
 - CompetitionsController#show
 - Printing::CompetitionsController#single_attempt_recording (CompetitionSignUp)
- Improve the styling of the Single Data Entry PDF:
 - Single Data entry PDF is 3 lines onto page #2.
 - Should we make it a long PDF with multiple pages.
 - Maybe make it number of competitors x2.
 - And put the Header on every page.
- Allow Pre-Assigning Heats for Competitions easily
 - Perhaps a view of exported data for the signed-up competitors would be sufficient?
- Add the "DNS" and "DNF" states to a competitor, and to import_results.
- In Group Competitior, it would be nice to have “number of people in group” (when displaying)


====== Nice to have
- Ensure that competitors who are not coming (deleted) are not showing up anymore.
- Online system which allows the public to see the Competitor List for each event.
- Per Registrant Results pages.
(email) Notify certain people whenever an event has been approved/locked.
- Change the SCSS include layout so that I can start building common styling elements, like @work.
- Add a "Refresh" button to every page (which just reloads the page)
- Look at using Turbolinks?
 - Use Carrierwave in a private bucket for PDFs (with expiring keys ?)
- Build a similar TwoAttemptEntry Review/Approve set (like the Single/ImportResult ones)
- enable feature test for two-attempt-entry. (needs JS)
- insteall simple_form_for (for two-attempt-entry form, to help with error reporting?)
- Improve the styling of the "Manage Competitors" page:
 - The “Manage Competitors” page has too many words.
 - In a group, the members of the group should be on separate lines each.
 - Name of the group should be in bold.
 - Same thing with country.
 - “Create/Sort Competitors” should be more obvious.
 - the "All"/"none" choices should not re-sort the list.
- Would it be possible to sort in HTML and Then export to PDF.
- Move the "PDF" link to be inside the HTML form on all pages, instead of next to the HTML pageview link.
- When publishing results, warn if there is missing data (what constitutes missing data?, but allow Admins to publish the results anyways (though other roles need to fix the data).
- Group Freestyle (and other non-age-group-having competitions): “Age Group" column is unnecessary

====== Other (not necessary in any way)
- Add ability to fix typo in user's name (when assigning data entry volunteers)
- Fix TravisCI
 - upgrade ruby.

======= Other Comments/thoughts
- Why make the HTML version available, always make it PDF.



==========================================================
Rulebook Comments (after having read through it once)
==========================================================
What is the way in which the High/Long competition will be run?
Connie has ideas about the “most efficient” way of running it. Who is the director, and how do they think it should be run?

Scott: section 4.6 Age Groups (Muni)
There are the age groups that must be used for Muni? (it seems to indicate this by saying "The following age groups are the maximum allowable for muni competitions:”


Section 5.7 Announcing of Results (Freestyle)
This seems to say that we are required to continuously announce the results of the judging. We have always restricted this information until after the awards. Is this still planned to be done?

Scetion 5.23 Individual Freestyle - Technical Score
Should "The Technical part of the judging is broken into four parts” be “three parts”?


5.25.1 Pairs Freestyle: Quantity of Unicycling Skills and Transitions

This section feels like it needs some grammatical correction.





===========================================================
Behaviour comments abotu Data Entry:
===========================================================
When doing data entry, adding data:
Only seeing the first set of data when there is more than 2 data entries for the same person.
The “search” box is being cut off because the footer is overlapping.
Single data entry, can we put the error box near the submit instead of the top.
When an error occurs, put the focus on the first box that is missing.
The error shouldn’t “or rank” because it doesn’t exist here
Don’t allow tab to the competition rulebook.
When there is double-entry it should be highlighted.

======================================================================================================================
======================================================================================================================
======================================================================================================================
======================================================================================================================
======================================================================================================================
======================================================================================================================



========================================
- Fix the ordering of import_results to always be :id (so that it odesn't shift around)



NAUCC data issues:
- Basketball/Hockey - Ranked competitions Without Age Groups? (should be able to calculate ranked without age group?)
- Various Age Groups need to be created/configured (like 10k Standard)
- How are Speed Trials being Judged/Data-entered?
- Does Speed Trials Advanced have Experts?
- Need ranking/scoring for Trials to be added.
- Does Trials have a separate "Expert" expert-off?


Patricia, Mary, do you have a summary of the awards that you are expecting to give out?
-


- Need to be able to enter data which may be a result for any copmetition in an event (like 10k's)


- allow admins/payment_admins to adjust the reg_fee of competitors

- set up scss stylesheets to properly inherit variables/mixins.

- caching of the judges/results pages

- how to display the cache digests dependencies graph?

- change to use pgbackups' weekly-retention policy?

- Fix the printing/names of competitors (they don't need the ID# in the name)
- Results for "includes finals" competitions should include the "overall place" (age-group-agnostic)
- Freestyle Presentation scores are only 3 categories (not 4)
 - Add ability to manage this?

- Add Warning on Registration Summary if this user doesn't have a confirmed USA membership?

- add functional test which simulates/uses the file upload flow, so that I can test that CSV upload works.

- Prevent not-qualified competitors from showing up on any competition sheets/judging/etc.
- Add "Confirmed Competitions" to the registrant sheet.
- Add "Not-confirmed competitions" to the registrant sheet.

- Should the new competitor be created when the Lane Assignment is created, or when the data is "approved" by the data-entry person. I think it should be when the Lane Assignment is created, because once that happens, we want to have a result for every Competitor.

- Need to enable the Lane-Assigner to enter a registrant who doesn't exist (for NAUCC). (also for Relay)

- Pages for Track Data Importing:
 - 1 Choose the Heat, and the file
 - 2. Import the data from the file, and see all the other data that has been entered for this heat. (by seeing the lane_assignment-data for this heat)
 - 3. Allow adjustments to the imported data (8-rows)
 - 4. Approve/import the data, (?thus removing it from the import_results?)
 - 5. Proceed by loading the next heat file (auto-increment the heat#)

 Make Lane-Assignment auto-increment the lane/heat as data is entered? (ask Kathleen?)

- Add test for lane_assignment, and view_heat and dq_request paths.

- add ability to enter finish results by-event (auto-selecting the correct competition)

- add feature tests for entering data through data-entry screens. (needs JS-runner?)

- Add inline editing of data:
  - allow editing of two-attempt-entry data, and single-attempt-entry data

- color code the different types of data (start times, end times)
Questions:
Section 2.1.4 (page 26)
- If Scott and Robin compete in 100m, and 1st (32 seconds) and 2nd (33 seconds) respectively
- And then they both compete in the finals, and have results of Scott: 31 seconds, Robin: 30 seconds.
THEN: What is the time and place awarded to Scott and Robin for the Age Group? (is it 1st/2nd, or 2nd/1st)

- Connie: Distance Champion: are 10k Standard placers eligible to qualify? (or do we just include the Unlimited?)


TO DO:
- Ensure that Boundary Score judging works (after the judgeable refactor, ties is probably broken)
- Prevent "final_candidates" from being selected from non-24" wheel-sizes

- Identify the flows for different data/users, and from that, identify missing pages.

- Look for the rulebook and check the cMobined competition logic.
- validatio on failure of two_attempt_entry

- Improve Competitor Management page, to make it easier to add new people who have signed up for an event to the competitors list.
 - Add ability to display/update registrants->competitors for a competition.
 - Prevent setting "AgeGroupType" and "Export"-ONLY boolean at Competition-level

- Create Competitions for all of the NAUCC 2014 events, so that I can learn how the flow works/doesn't work.
 - ADjust to make this easier/better...but keep it as a Super-Admin function for now.

IDEAL Admin HOMEPAGE shows the following data:
Category Event Competition #Sign Up #Competitors #Results Entered
 - Link to the Event, which allows detailed management
 - Link to the competition, Shows a summary of which event_categories were sourced, and how to manage the competitors, etc.
 - Sign ups links to a page which shows the sign-ups for the

- Fix/add caching of competition_source counts, so that it is updated when a new registrant signs up, or a new result occurs in a dependent competition....(how should this work? ...especially with the gender filter applied)
 - Counter_caches?

- Need a way to Display the results of a Combined competition
- need a way to print awards for a Combined Competition

- Create a Report which lists the competitions, including the scoring rules, experts medals rules, etc.
- Add a link to the registrants#show_all (for printing the registration packet PDFs)
- Re-envision the way that Award Labels menu should work (since we have a lot of this data in advance now, in the Competition configuration)

- Allow DNS and DNF results
- Ensure that a locked Competition doesn't allow any more modifications to results/competitors/etc.
- Prevent Competitor Destroy_all action if there are results for the competitors
  - Do this in a Transaction?

- Allow Chief Judge to import External Results for their competition.
- ?Split apart import_results for ExternalResults and LIF-Heat results, and Raw-Time Results?
- Need to create a way to Print the Imported Data, for use when doing Data Entry for a MUni Event?
 - NEed to descide when we want to use ImportResult#data_entry vs TimeResults#Index for data entry
- ADd ability for Chief Judge to enter Two-Attempt_entry Data. (or for a judge to do so?).
 - Perhaps have any :judge be able to enter data into the import table, but only allow director to import that data across (once verified)


- Create role of "Award Printer"
- Create role of "Announcer"


Nice to have:

Low Priority:
- BBall: Team Captain/Referee toggle
-

- Separate "Track" scoring vs other time-based scor tracking. (so that import only asks for LIF at appropriate times)
- Add tests for distance_attempt_score calculator ("Two Attempt Distance")
- Handle Multi-lap race recording/calculation/reporting

- Add better debugger gem.
- Make the breadcrumbs sticky.
- New Navigation Structure (using Breadcrumbs?)
 - create a Category#index page which shows the Evetns in the category (and update the breadcrumbs to point here)
- New Menu Bar (not custom-made?)
- The NAV menu is overlaying/colliding with the breadcrumbs. fix this.

- break apart the registrants#index controller (weird manage_all thing)
- Merge the RegistrantExpenses controller into the registrant_expense_items controller?

- Remove Judge from DistanceAttempt (as there is no need to keep different judge's distance Attempts separated, right?)


ADMIN Config-Watching View:
- List all Event Categories, and show which competition they are associated with. (Each should be associated with at least 1)
- Make Lane Assignment JS, so that it doesn't have to reload the whole page every time.

- Need to be able to print the Artistic Judging Helper sheets (for paper recording, later transcribing into the UDA)
- Clean up the ArtisticEdit view partial, and the boundary score thing.
- Clean up StreetScore Controller, and adjust it to match the rulebook for scoring.
- Add a printed page for paper-recording of Street Scores.
- Should Chief Judges be allowed/able to Update/Delete Scores and StreetScores? (or should only the specific Judge be able to?) I think yes.
- link director to competitions#export_scores, possibly also make it nicer?

- Show the "attempt number" which was faster.
- Disqualified should be "no"/"" instead of "true/false"
- Add test path for payment-presenter"
- Fix image path in scss references (compiled vs dev)


===== below this line (not likely to happen) =====


- Ensure that when placing competitors, if they have no time/data they have a place of 0 with status DNF?
- Check the Live NAUCC 2013 site to see if the competitions for BBall/Hockey are associated with any event_categories or not.
 - Change migration to select the "only" event_category if there is only one???

- Increase test coverage based on simplecov report
- Figure out what partial-refactoring https://github.com/lailsonbm/awesome_nested_fields meant
- Improve the styling of the Competitor->Member form.
- Combine the EventCategory and Event controllers so that all creation/updat/deletion of event_categories happens through an event.
- Combine the EventChoice and Event controllers, so that all creation/update/deletion of event_choices happens through an event.
- Enhance the "mark items as paid for" to allow for arbitrary number of "other" elements....adding them by JS.
- Allow CombinedCompetition + Entries to be a single controller.
- Remove remnants of AdminAbility and Admin::BaseController (start with AdjustmentPayment controller?)
- Improve the Adjustment Payment system, and add tests for it, so that it can be used by non-Robin
- Store the logo in a cache? (or someplace other than in the database)
- Move Chief Judge creation into the Permissions Controller (though it can still be from events#show TOO)
- Move the role-specific changes out of judgesController and into PermissionsController (some are redundant too?)
- Redirect to the previous page upon change of role.

- Update the instructions for setting up a development or server
- update to use database.yml and secrets.yml the rails-4 way?

- find a way to test/fix that we prevent registrants from seeing other-registrants' data (if they can create, they must be able to view?)


- Add ability to upload music for competitions
- add a limit of 500 places between all 3 lodging types.

- Add caching around scoring, judged_place, placing_points
- NAUCC 2013 registrants#show_all doesn't work (too slow)
- determine how to deal with performance issues when sorting on cached field.
- learn more about acts_as_list for position usage (for competitor#position)
- prevent sorting when clicking all/none on competitors#index page
- add warning on the "Registrants (edit)" page for any registrant which is "Not Valid"
- scoring freestyle "Back" button brings me nowhere
- figure out why error message (unable to add registrant 2x) isn't being displayed.
- make JS for the competitors#index page for "select all/none"

- Specify a racers "Default Wheel Size" or their registration, so that they might notice/correct it.
 - Allow choosing the 20" wheel size for 0-10 for 10k.

- Update the wiki to better describe the scoring_helper, and other filters

- Add form tags or other ways to make the "only_registered" (and other) 'printing' options obvious/accessible.
- Add "No Competitions Exists, Create one now" buttons (and other places too).
- Put a "Back" button on every page in a consistent location.
- Make the navigation bar always the same styling unless we have selected something.

********* THIS IS THE POINT AT WHICH I've stopped prioritizing/sorting things *********

=============================
Registration-Related ToDo
=============================

----ROBIN's CURRENT LIST:


Most Useful:
- Move ALL results to be associated with a judge? (this way we can easily allow multiple judges to enter results, even for 10k)??

- Add DNF, DNS, and DQ-Reason to data-entry (where? reason should be separate from the LIF results, I think)
- Fix printing of PDFs with special characters (ie: french characters)

DESIGN:
 - Associate competitions with event_categories (instead of the other way around)
 - Add display to registrants-printing page which shows all competitors that they have associated? (to show the age groups, etc?)

Less useful:
- prevent selecting dates which are not possible (Scott problem).
- Add monthly reminders to people who haven't paid?
- Wrap Permissions (on User) properly, so that cancan sees/manages it (currently it's can?(:manage, User))

Payment-related:
- When paying for something, remove it from the paid-elements, even if it's free. (free IUF should eliminate to-be-paid IUF)
- Marking Wire Payments received for Lodging doesn't eliminate the previous lodging entry.
- IPN with no invoice number should include whole post information.
 - determine if there is a way to prevent all things from getting sent to me?
- Menu submenu onclick, and always have a 2nd level.

Minor:
- Make a single expense_group for registration_fees, and prevent using it elsewhere.
- On the payments#summary page, display items which are for "paid-for" registrants, vs not-paid-for registrants (?)
 - Add a column to the admin/payments/ page which shows the number of "free" items that have been "paid for".
 - Add new "num free" column to the Payments#summary page
- Improve the way that admin's can view/add payments to a user. Both "Onsite Payments" and "Free Item for special person".

---- END ROBIN's CURRENT LIST:

===========================================================
===========================================================

Minor:
- Fix "Admin" to be unable to see menu options which are not permitted to them.
- Move remaining "Payments" items out of the "admin" scope.
- UTF8 encoding of the list elements sent to Paypal (to allow for french characters) Search "Notification of payment received" in e-mail
- Show the price rates/dates even on non-signed-in page?
- replace has_details/print_details with common helper function?
 - Display the "details" for payment entries of paid entries on various places where it is displayed
- Allow html in the mass-mailer (and plaintext too?)
- look at using 'https://github.com/croaky/parity'
- .env template?
- limit rooms to 1000 (total), with a warning function at 80%?
- add documentation to methods as per: http://globaldev.co.uk/2013/10/ruby-tips-part-4/
- Rename onsite to adjustment
- prevent PaymentExpense from being created without details (for those which have details)
- include "translations" in the loads of data (N+1 record thing)
- Translate "Please Wait" from buttons
- upgrade to ruby 2.0
- drop the base columns for the translated attributes?

Other:

- Fix the Import bug which breaks the id generator (scott did this, again)
- functional test which shows that registrant_group can be created
- functional test which shows that creating a competitor registrant can work, and updating a registrant can work
- functional test which shows that creating a non-competitor can work, and updating a registrant can work

- fix the shared_error messages count only include entries which have a non-empty text field.
- When marking an item as free for someone, eliminate their registrant_expense_item somehow?
- combine the _expense_list.html.erb and the other (similar) partials
- Add ability to search for registrants by name, instead of always by ID. (wherever we do registrant-choosing). perhaps via a javascript helper function or something.
- Only display the "Gender Filter" when creating a competition (not on edit)
- Clarify how to assign a user as a "Lane Assignment User", and where to enter that information
- Check to see that all of the Controllers are using Registrant.order(...) correctly (it's overridden by the default_scope).
- Replace the current AwardLabel model with the new one (so that we can clean up the AwardLabel generation logic)
- Identify all remaining non-translated texts, and put them into the locale files for english and french (and send them to Hugo)
- Provide Rolf with a view which shows him the Teams/Team captains, etc
- Update the Admin functions for when users are "Admin"....mostly read-only.
- Auto-fill the "Name of Guest" in the Lodging with the current registrant's name.
- Get rid of XXX
- Ensure that all roles can perform all the actions that they want/expect to be able to do
- Update/create Standard Skill Scoring system, replacing the UCP

- Limit the rooms to 1000 by all types (not per type of room)

Technical:
- Re-work the printing/competitions controller, so that it shares more logic with the non-pdf versions of results-displaying??
- Replace the "Save" link with an argument for controller (since we don't need 2 paths which do the same PDF thing)


Categories:
Data Generating
Data Gathering
Data Entry

Team Sports - Freestyle - Muni - Road Racing - Track & Field - Urban
|
+-> Basketball
+-> Hockey


Need:
- Landing page for each Event, which shows options:
 *** Sign-up ***
 - List of competitors who have chosen on registration
  - by age group, etc
 - List of heats

 *** Data Entry ***
 - Import (link to page)
 - List of heats
 - See existing results (in imported order, in ?other? order)
  - abliity to change data
 - Place competitors
 - Print options for confirmation (and for posting, and more)


Feature:
- Datacheck field
- Create heats based on inputted data (best -time, etc)
- Should I change user's sign-ups to reflect changes to the competitor-sign-ups. (so that people see confirmation of changes)
- Be able to give other users the permissions that THEY have themselves. (Kathleen gives Scott permissions...)
- Need a way to choose the options for an event (in advance), so that the forms are specific to the event and the data-gathering mechanism.





To Do sometime soon:
- Update the Events Report to list the sign-ups on a per-country breakdown
- Update all dependencies to latest versions
- Replace magic strings with class constants
- "Connie also wants the ability to print all results for a whole event type (i.e. distance) so use some sort of combine pdf function."

Possible (but not required):
- Allow changing the Bib Numbers for people.
- Combine multiple expenses onto one line for ease of seeing.
- Add "# remaining" to the Items page when the items are limited in number

- write documentation that describes the major features of the system
- Write tutorials:
 - that show how to set up the system for registration
 - that show how to set up the events
 - that show how to enter judging results for races
 - that show how to do artistic judging

Nice-to-have:
- Figure out how to restore the pg-sequences, so that we don't get key collisions in the future
 - Due to the "import" feature I think

In support of making NAUCC competitors happier:
- Create "Participation Cerificate" which lists each Competitor's all results

To Do (other requests):
- Fix Import results CSV to allow for Mac-based CSV files (not windows-only)
- Add the "Heat/Lane" to the results listing page (and some reports too?)
- Create "Overall Champion" calculation system
- Create "Expert T-Shirt" calculation system
- Create "Personalized Schedule" for each competitor
- Replace "Distance" with "Timed"
- Put "DQ" after all of the places on the results printouts
- Allow setting of a sort order on the age groups (for printing, I suspect).
- Fix the import/export to include event_category (seems to have been missed for unicon2014 import)
- Make the footer nicer (like UCP)
- Add indicator to the Import Results page which shows whether the given competitor already has a result record stored (this would be a BAD thing)
- UI for configuring a racer's "Default Wheel Size"
- Make the site more robust when creating/deleting expense items/registration periods (scott broke it easily by deleting an expense item, I think)

??- Results should include overall place.
- Awards labels . "Clear whole column"
- Autocomplete for Club Name, Group Name, etc.
- Re-write the artistic calculation code to use the new caching strategy, and also to optimize so that the same calculations are not done multiple times (for each place(competitor) call)
- fix problems when the age groups are not large enough, or when a person's age is >100 (and out of range of the age groups) (problems printing PDFs, etc)
- Use more Form Helpers (like the RegistrantGroup form helper)
- Update roles,to allow certain admin users to be able to create results (external results, import results)
- What happens if a competitor has no members? (do the pages display? do the calculations die?)
- When the server is running locally, log all errors to a database table (and allow viewing of this).
 - Perhaps _always_ log errors to this table, and e-mail if possible?
- Allow for people to pay via Paypal while "onsite registrant"???
- Opensource the Rulebook software
 - address some of the rulebook software issues (See Jan23 E-mail)
- Create a new builder for the controller/scaffold function, without a 'new' page, and without a 'show' page

- Finish the Artistic Group/Club for Falls.
- Num Laps for time results (Coker MUni cross)
- UI for using the "International (Ineligible)" selection for registrants.
- Should be able to enter obstacle course data (multiple data points, fastest wins)

- Import Data without a Heat/Lane should show a nice error message
 - With a link to the Heat/lane data for lookup
- Don't eliminate places which are not affected by new time_results
- Fix association between Competitions and events (separate from event-categories?)
 - So that the Expert Competition can be properly associated.

LESS IMPORTANT THINGS:
- Improve the "Manage Judges" menu for each competition
- Ability to create Artistic Group/Pairs competitions based on the fields filled out (?)
- Should be able to capture the "DQ" and "DQ reason" fields in a form easily ,for use by the finish judge.
- Improve the UI of the "My Events" page, so that the "Heat assignment" people have:
 - A short list of the available competitions
 - The speed/lane-assignment information
 - Instructions
- Lane Assignments Heat/Lane/Comptetion should be unique
 - And should show nice error message if you get it wrong

FUTURE THINGS (LATER):
- Booleans in models should be "?" like? ("has_experts?")
- Make the "Lane Assignment" a role that can be added to a user, separate from the normal "judge" role.
- Improve the "My Events" view for judges by "ordering" the competitions?
- Be able to print the Race Results by Age Group more easily.
- Improve the formatting of the Score data entry
- Improve the formatting of the Chief JUdge view-all-scores report
- Fix problem when typing in value for "position" and getting it wrong (and it breaks the system)
- SUMMARY:
 - Improve the time spent to generate the Summary page (so that the all-summary works in <15 seonds)
 - Mark Atkinson's Sumarry is 2 pages, why?
 - no-wrap the age-group cell contents
 - Keyboard Shortcuts for most common functions
- Add Blank Expert Heat Lane Assignment Forms (for both 6-lane and 8-lane tracks?)
- Improve the formatting of the Lane Assignment role instructions-
- "Are you leaving at the end of competition"? (question for registrants at check-in time).



UNCATEGORIZED:
- Should be able to more easily enter Time Results data by hand (dq,s etc) (not required that the racer be a competitor?)
- Fix TimeResult dropdown,order, to be sorted, and show ? non-signed-up-people?
- Ability to specify a "name" for user accounts, so that I can refer to "judge" accounts properly.
?- Ability to show the Events, Judges, so that the Chief Judge can determine the next events' judges in advance

- Prevent multiple judges from entering results for the same registrant in TimeResults
- Improve ability to modify/manage registration data on UDA for on-site modifications.


Standard Skill:
- Bring across tests
- Figure out how to isolate the logic (create a new model?)
- Add "Print list" option for standard skill report.
- Add administrative option which shows signed-up vs filled-out.

Remove Version table and paper_trail...replace with something else?

TODO:
Add ability to download payment and address details?
Make page views more responsive
Ask Hugo how to fix the registrant_expense_item <-> Payment_Detail conversion, I don't think I should need to do this...but I don't know a better way.
Fix all the separate loops which print the expense items (owed, paid, free), as they appear redundant, and should probably be combined somewhere?....what about the "can delete" actions?
