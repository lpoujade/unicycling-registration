Notes from May 24,2014 with Connie:

BBall - Competitior List, Asssign Reg-> Comp, print Comp List with members, Enter Ranked places, Approved Entered data, Lock event, Post Data, Print Awards, Print Labels, Mark Labels done.

Individual - Show by Age Group, Age Group Management (needs love), randomize competitor order, manual competitor re-order, Add/Manage judges, list/print judges, mark comptitor as no-show, olck results, awards print, awards labels, awards done, post

Pairs/Group, same as above, with 2-medals occurring

MUni CC-Beginner - Manage Age Groups, Post Competitors by Age Group, Enter start times, with the same start time for many people, see competitors without data and data without competitors before "approving (importing)" the data. awards....

10k - Print/export registrant data with Best Time (for use by chief judge when creating start-lists).

100m - Show by age group, line up referee show lane assignments, ref can DNS/DQ/Reason/who-is-dq-er, import action should only allow if it matches the heat data. Import action without approval results in all heat entries having data (due to DNS/DNF/DQ), Print/display/results by age group, for showing to competitors (Include a flag/action which triggers notification/PDF?), lock (no more inputs), see data by heat (admin-only).



=== below this line is PRE-may-24-2014.
- Adjust the Advanced XC data by 2 minutes (they started later.

- Who gets expert T-Shirts?
 - Pick the events that qualify for an expert t-shirt
  - Determine who came in top-3, and then combine all of these people into a list.
  - List the shirt-size for each of these competitors.
  - Allow adding another competition if there are still shirts/etc.

WHAT WENT POORLY:
- Printing of reports
- Need an Excel Import that is Connie Friendly


POST-NAUCC2013 Report/Requests:

- Personalized Schedule, Page 2 of the registration package
 - Awesome feature: include the full convention schedule, highlighting the events that the registrant is signed up for.
 - Includes all competition events, and ONLY competition events.

 - I want to have a "Publish to Website" button for each competition results.
  - To be used/synchronized on a nightly basis.
   - Connie: automagically? Make it simple to publish the results to the website.
 - Make PDFs of the results available for PUBLIC consumption.
  - Make personalized results pages available for each competitor.

 - Make the Overall Champion calculation part of UDA.
  - Track: ties are resolved by the number of 1sts, then by place of 100m. Points: 8,6,4,2,1
  - MUni: (at nationals, only) 3 events, and ties are resolved by number of 1sts, then number of 2nds, then 3rd places, 4th places, 5th, and then by Cross-country.
  - Distance: Each event has X points for 1st through 10th. Ties are resolved by number of 1sts, 2nds, thirds, fourths, fifths, then by Marthon.
  - Be able to publish the resuts of the calculation during the week (before all the events have been competed).

 - Have a page which lists the events, according to the schedule, and whether the data has been entered, posted, published, awarded.
  - Should be at the Competition Level.
  - Show the events that have been competed, but not completed should be highlighted.

- Allow the Event Director to upload their own data (Trials, Street, Flat, etc)

- Allow Concurrent-Heat data entry (enter the heat number and start time, and then the competitor numbers for that start time).
 - Allows entering the finish data directly.

- Be able to enter the 2 results for the MUni Uphill, which will be able to show the better attempt
 - Should be able to enter the start time separately from the end time (for MUNi Uphill), or via heats (Crit Standard)
 - May be able to configure this to be a special case for Obstacle, MUNi Up/down, Long/High, etc.

- Make Startlist generation less manual
 - Some way of creating next heats based on previously-raced events.

- 100m Expert Race should be populated by the 100m Top finishers
 - Include a Report which shows the way that experts are positioned on the track

- Have a tablet at the start time which shows the HEAT number, Age Group, Event, Competitors (Large ID, Large First, (small Last))
 - Be able to enter DQ entries (for 1ft, for example).
- Have the person sitting with The Electronic Timer (at track) be communicating with the Photo-timer person to ensure that Finish times, Lanes, and DQ's are recorded properly).

- Specify that an event is a "Multi-registrant Event" which means that administrators can pre-associate multiple registrants together into a single "group"
 - Useful for Pairs, Group, Club, Hockey, BBall, Relay.
 -- Have the ability to pre-associate people to the groups, so that when createing the competitors list, it has data to pull from.


 ** Calculation of the Experts cannot use results which are in the 20"or 16" category.

 * User must choose their wheel size for ALL track events (points races) (100m, 400m, 800m, Obstacle, 1ft, WW)


- Improve the flow of the High/Long recordincg, to better match the way that they run the event.
- Multi-lap calculations should possible.
- DNF should be possible.

- Have the data entry for separetly-timed events by done in UDA. (MUNI Uphill for example).
 - START TIME:  Enter ID, hour, minutes, seconds, hour (2), Minute(2), second(2). (Don't want to have to enter the ID twice).
 - FINISH TIME: Enter ID, hour, minutes, seconds.
- Entering data directly into UDA needs to be less cumbersome.
 - Right now, it's not at all like Excel.

 THINGS to fix:
 - Give people 4 safety pins.
 UPS Backups for the Router.
 - Major and Minor faults are counted by 2 people and averaged, and then those scores are used by all of the judegs.

- Need a better system to deal with incoming data, processed data.
=================================

- Add ability to add competitors from multiple event_categories to a single competition (or allow adding them later, one at a time)

- Move the time_trials Results to be shown by Competition, and the "set_places"
 - Fail the import if any rows are not-parsable?
 - Fail the import if any of the resulting data is invalid?

- Why can't I import the 10kStandard.csv (file format issues?)
- Link to the Time Results (view) page (/time_results/index?)
- Link To the Time Results Import Page
- Link to the "Set Places" page


Connie Wants:
- Registration system which tracks when someone has picked up their registration package?
 - Flag people who have not picked up their registration package.
 - Be able to search for a registrant, and mark that they are picked up.
 - Indicate any registrants who have not picked up their registration packet (on their name?)
- Mark people who have not paid as special (perhaps by adjusting their name?)
 - On the Race Sign up forms, indicate that these people are not likely to show up.....maybe don't put them on the list until they are paid too.
 - Not even on the "eligible" list for race sign-ups.
- Clarify the fact that the Competition people are RANDOMIZED

July Questions:
- Do I need to have event_classes: Track, Standard Skill? (I'm currently not setting the Standard Skill one, and I am using "Two Attempt distance for the other one").


TO DO (MUST be done BEFORE LIVE):
- Add ability to show the registrants "Signed up" for an Event (eg: Individual Ferestyl, Male, 15+)
 - Add ability to "Reorder Competitors" (which will create a Competitor object and set the Position.

- Make the "shared registrant" banner disappear (or de-highlight) when accepted
- Prevent users from saving a payment in progress over the boundary?

 - Should I titlize the names of the registrants?
 - add unique constraints on database level?
  - when using unicorn to serve multiple people at once, what do I need to consider?
  - require shared
  - require friend
 - Use nesting in scss to combine things that have common parents
 - Remove all json responds to, except where I need it. (and remove all respond_to blocks).
 - Make more events AJAX instead of refresh the page.
 - Use "div_for" instead of writing div id's by hand.
  - For Standard Skill?
  - For Expenses?

 - use delegate to get rid of law-of-demeter violations (allow_nil?)

 - Restrict Final heat candidates to 24" wheel size. (via query?)
 - Default sort order for AgeGroupEntry.
 - Ability to copy one gender to another gender
  - Ability to "Create both" at the same time ,instead?
  - Prevent one gender's results from affecting another gender's?
 - Cache the age of the registrant
 - Add in-place eding of tables (like the Registration Periods entries?)
 - Add a scope for signed_up registrant_event_sign_ups (to get rid of the "if category is nil"
 - Create ability to invite people for clubs admin
 - Restrict permsissions of "admin" user to ????
 - Add tests for the club-admin (or whatever it becomes) flows
 - Add ability for admin user to see/create new payments (but not delete?)
 - Add tests which ensure that the layout/application is working correctly (was broken when not signed in)

- mixpanel revenue?
 - Improve the "success" page (http://reg.uninationals2013.com/payments/success?tx=8PY73818JH738005M&st=Completed&amt=120.00&cc=USD&cm=&item_number=)
- Add Administrative Options similar to what we had on the old registration site:

 - PayPal
  - Prevent people from starting a payment, and then finishing it months later for cheap.
 - Prevent changing a payment's contents after it is _paid_
 - Make a note that the Name/Country is listed for all registrants to see.
 - Try it with different browsers

TO DO (MUST be done SOON after LIVE (if not before)):
 - Follow hugo's example for configuration blocks.
 - Ensure that payments from the previous payment period are stored properly during movement
 - Export/Import functions for the WHOLE dataset?
 - Payments page which lists all Unpaid Registrations (and e-mail contact info?)
 - Multi-Edit (allows updating the selection of multiple people's choices)
 - Multi-record delete (allows removing multiple people from an event sign-up)
 - Log all logs to an external (persistent) store
 - :dependent => :restrict


TO DO (SHOULD be done):
 - Fix some styling of the page, to make it easier to follow the flow of the system.
 - Admin should be able to "receive a cheque"
  - This allows an admin to mark a record/item as paid without PayPal
  - ReceivedCheque should have "notes"
 - Perhaps don't show the "name" of the registration Periods (it's confusing?)
  - It's still showing during the payment-process steps
  **
  - CLEARER that kids must have a Parent/Guardian sign the waiver form. (page for waiver)
 - Add javascript tests for event_choice#autocomplete
 - Re-arrange StandardSkillRoutineEntry/StandardSkillRoutine validations (move into Routine)
 - JS/CSS for standardSkill should be moved into asset pipeline
 - Ability to read StandardSkill Routines even after Online Registration is closed.
 - Ability to print PDF of standard Skill Routine, for practicing by competitor?


TO DO (NICE to be done):
 - Admin page for the events page....should show num people signed up vs num people signed-up-and-paid.
 - Add something that helps describe What "Category" to sign up for when choosing "Individual Freestyle" (Categories are: "Age Group", "Jr. Expert", "Expert").
 - Improve the "Summary" page to be prettier, and better at printing.
 - Test the site on multiple browsers
 - User Test the site to see about usability improvements
 - Integrate with USA Membership site
 - Add ability to mark a Registration as paid, to deal with "Dave said that I could go for free" scenario(s).
 - Serve the logo from a better (cached) fashion
 - expense items be destroyed when an expenseGroup is destroyed
 - Prevent events from having no position-1-event-choice-boolean

Scott's suggestions:
 - Admin should be able to identify Who+WHAT has been received/paid for.
 - Pay now gets its own line
 - Payment page checkmarks with running total. When boxes are checked, highlight line.
 - Immediate errors display when typing in.
 - How do we get BEST TIMES?
 - Automatically start the rails server when vagrant starts
 - All registrants page, add 'state' column?

Caitlin's Notes:
 - Don't need a phone number?
  - Why need an emergency contact phone number, but not mine.
 - should be instructions for "print and sign" the waiver?
 - After adding a new thing, goes to the T-Shirt page again....want to go back to the registration summary page.
  - Need to deal with how to get to the T-Shrit page....?
  - "Save and return to Registrant List"

Denis:
- Treats the sign-in as a sign-up.
- Where do I provide e-mail my e-mail address
- "What am I doing on the t-shirt page"?
- "Show my registrations" means "about robin's competitions?"
 - I can use "My registrations" to create new.
 - "Done" or "new registraiton"?
- Is team required to be asked for a non-competitor?
- Always go back to the Registration smumary page (on return from the payment success)
- How do I finish?
 - Make the Waiver thing biggenr, bolder, etc. make it a apage in the flow.

NEED To make the registration deadlines clear.
- Exiting with a balance due, cause a popup?

Mom:
- "New Competitor" as a button isn't clear. it looks like a banner/description.
 - "Click here"
- "Why is Legal Waiver" in red? I can ignore the Red, I guess.
- "Legal Waiver" is still showing in red? why?
- Need to tell the person that an e-mail will be sent to them with their payment details.

Connie:
- Why is the address below the events
- Can we add "levels" to the Indiviudal/Pairs categores
- Are we doing Standard skill?
- Validate the age of competitors for Individual freestyle categores?
- R: I don't like the fact that I need to scroll on the "Items" page.

-------------

TODO (flesh out and implement)
BestTimeType:
- Name
- Description
- Initial Value
- Increment step(s)?

To Be answered by the Event Organizers:

 Should not be able to change the type of a given field once created.
 Should warn about changing the name of an event, because it may change the value of the....
 Cascade delete....

N+1 queries
Validations from RecordValidator

Check that the placeholder text works in other browsers, or add jquery fix for it?
 - add http://selectivizr.com/ ??
CSS Reset?
smidget?
prevent form leaving modified form page
Try different ways of displaying the Event Catgories.
Use SASS to inherit css properties.

Add Tests for when a configuration doesn't exist yet (ensure the site loads/etc)

Possibly use "stripes" for the creditcard vendor.
Competitor Information is Almost never Changed.

Better way to navigate back to Registrants page.
Make the Pay Now a button-like-thing.. For a Sinlge Registrant, Make the Pay Now part of the regsitration.
add ability to restrict deletion of registrants and users, if there are related records in payments.

For Nan:
- CSS Reset?
- Style of the a hrefs, so that they are visible.
- Help with the banner

- Registration Periods should have unique expense items (so that we can directly match a payment) (ie. No two registration periods should have the same expense items)
- Registration Preidos should also have unique items between comp and non-comp
- Add more destroy-restrict codes (see payment_detail<->expense_item)
